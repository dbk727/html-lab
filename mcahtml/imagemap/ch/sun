<p>The Sun is
the star at the center of our solar system, providing the light and heat essential for life on Earth. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, primarily hydrogen and helium, that generates energy through nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, and its energy drives Earth's weather, climate, and seasons.</p>
